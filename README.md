# LMI Data Source for Spotfire速

## Description
The LMI Data Source for Spotfire creates a new data source type that connects to an LMI instance.
There are four ways to use this LMI data source:
- Run a new query (EQL or SQL formated)
- Retrieve results for an existing query (a tab in the UI)
- Run a new Correlation query (ECL formated)
- Retrieve results from an existing correlation search (a tab in the UI)

Results are entirely retrieved from LMI and stored in Spotfire memory, once this is done all the usual Spotfire interactions with the data are possible.

This works with both the analyst client, and the web client.

## Pre-requisites
This has been tested with TIBCO Spotfire速 7.11 and TIBCO Spotfire速 X (10.0.0 - 10.1.0).
TIBCO LogLogic速 Log Management Intelligence 6.2.0 and above is supported

## Package installation
The provided .spk file must be uploaded to Spotfire server, and deployed in an area.
If you are using the web client, the web player must be updated, as indicated in the web player management screen.
For the analyst client, the update will be pushed at next restart. You need to accept the installaiton of the non-signed extensions the first time.

## Usage
You need to fill in the hostname for your LMI host, and a user/password pair for authentication.
For the analyst client, the certificate checking may pop-up a prompt for you to review and accept.
For the web client, the LMI certificate MUST be trusted (i.e. must be from a well known issuer, and match the hostname).
If needed, it works with free let's encrypt certificates and  wildcard let's encrypt certificates.

For every EQL/SQL query, you must include a filter on sys_eventTime (e.g. for EQL '| sys_eventTime in -1h')
You cannot use bloks.

For ECL you need to type in the whole content of an ECL blok, and add a line on top that gives the rule name using the syntax:
Rule <rule name>
  
You can add a new LMI data source using either:
(+) Other / "From LogLogic LMI Advanced Search" (this only works for spotfire analyst)
or
Tools / LogLogic data sources / Add advanced search data 

For TIBCO Spotfire Web, you need to add another (dummy) data source before being able to add an LMI data source using the tools menu.

## Building the package

You need Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, the TIBCO Spotfire SDK for the targeted release.
In build.ps1 script, update the following variables according to the locations of the SDK and the sources.

```
$env:MSBUILDPATH="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\"
$env:SPOTFIREPACKAGEBUILDERCONSOLEPATH="<path to>\TIBCO Spotfire SDK\10.1.0\SDK\Package Builder\"
$env:BUILDHOME="<path to>\LMIDataSource"
```

Then launch the build script, the final artifact is LmiDataSource.sdn
